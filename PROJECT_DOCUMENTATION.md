# Canvas Taint Solution

## Problem
When an image from a different origin is drawn onto a canvas, the canvas becomes "tainted." This is a security measure to prevent information leakage. A tainted canvas cannot be exported to an image using `toDataURL()`.

## Solution
The solution is to use a proxy to fetch the image. The proxy fetches the image from the external source and serves it from the same origin as the application. This tricks the browser into thinking the image is from the same origin, thus avoiding the canvas taint issue.

### Implementation
1.  **Proxy Server:** Set up a simple proxy server. In this project, a Cloudflare Worker is used.
2.  **Image URL:** Modify the image URL to go through the proxy. Instead of `https://example.com/image.png`, use `https://your-proxy.workers.dev/?url=https://example.com/image.png`.
3.  **CORS Headers:** Ensure the proxy server sets the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to `*` to allow cross-origin requests.
4.  **html2canvas:** Use the `useCORS` option in `html2canvas` and set the `crossOrigin` attribute of the image to `anonymous`.

# Deployment Guide

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Steps
1.  **Push to `main`:** Ensure all changes are committed and pushed to the `main` branch.
2.  **GitHub Pages Settings:** In the repository settings, under "Pages," ensure the source is set to deploy from the `main` branch and the root directory.
3.  **Custom Domain:** If using a custom domain, configure it in the GitHub Pages settings and add a `CNAME` file to the repository with the domain name.

# Download Debugging Guide

## Problem
The download functionality might fail due to several reasons.

### Common Issues
1.  **Canvas Taint:** As described in `CANVAS_TAINT_SOLUTION.md`, this is the most common issue.
2.  **Large Images:** Very large images can cause `html2canvas` to fail or create a very large data URL that the browser cannot handle.
3.  **Browser Restrictions:** Some browsers have restrictions on programmatic downloads.
4.  **Ad Blockers:** Ad blockers or other browser extensions might interfere with the download process.

### Debugging Steps
1.  **Check Console:** Open the browser's developer console and look for any errors.
2.  **Test with Simple Content:** Try downloading a simple slide with no images to see if the basic functionality works.
3.  **Test Image URLs:** Ensure all image URLs are accessible and load correctly.
4.  **Disable Extensions:** Disable all browser extensions and try again.

# Download Fix Solution

## Problem
The download functionality was unreliable. It sometimes failed silently or produced a corrupted image.

## Solution
The solution involved several improvements:

1.  **Error Handling:** Added `try...catch` blocks around the `html2canvas` call to catch any errors and display a user-friendly message.
2.  **Loading Indicator:** Implemented a loading indicator to show the user that the download is in progress. This prevents the user from clicking the download button multiple times.
3.  **Delay:** Added a small delay before and after the `html2canvas` call to ensure the DOM is fully rendered.
4.  **Refactoring:** The download logic was moved to a separate utility module (`DownloadUtils.js`) for better organization and reusability.

# Font Fix Solution

## Problem
Custom fonts were not being rendered correctly in the downloaded image. `html2canvas` does not automatically embed fonts.

## Solution
The solution is to embed the fonts directly into the SVG that `html2canvas` uses to render the image.

### Implementation
1.  **Fetch Font:** Use `fetch` to get the font file as a `Blob`.
2.  **Convert to Base64:** Convert the `Blob` to a Base64 encoded string.
3.  **Create `@font-face`:** Create a `<style>` element with a `@font-face` rule that uses the Base64 encoded font data.
4.  **Append to DOM:** Append the `<style>` element to the document's `<head>` before calling `html2canvas`.

This ensures that the font is available to the browser when it renders the canvas for `html2canvas`.

# Image Upload Implementation

## Feature
Allow users to upload their own images to be used in the slides.

## Implementation
1.  **File Input:** Added an `<input type="file" accept="image/*">` element.
2.  **Event Listener:** Added a `change` event listener to the file input.
3.  **FileReader:** When a file is selected, use the `FileReader` API to read the file as a data URL (`readAsDataURL`).
4.  **Update Image:** Once the file is read, set the `src` of the target image element to the data URL.

This is managed by the `ImageUploadManager.js` component.

# Multilingual API Integration

## Feature
Integrate a translation API to support multiple languages.

## API
This project uses the Google Translate API.

## Implementation
1.  **API Key:** Obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console.
2.  **`LanguageManager.js`:** This component handles the API calls.
3.  **`fetch` Request:** Use `fetch` to make a POST request to the Google Translate API endpoint.
4.  **Request Body:** The request body includes the text to be translated, the source language, and the target language.
5.  **Update UI:** Once the translation is received, update the text content of the relevant elements in the UI.

# Multilingual Fonts

## Problem
Different languages require different fonts to render correctly. A single font might not support all characters (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, Korean).

## Solution
1.  **Font Subsetting:** Use different fonts for different languages.
2.  **CSS Font Stacks:** Use CSS font stacks to specify a list of fonts. The browser will use the first font in the list that supports the characters.
3.  **Dynamic Font Loading:** When the language is changed, dynamically update the `font-family` of the relevant elements.
4.  **Google Fonts:** Use Google Fonts to easily import and use a wide variety of fonts.

The `LanguageManager.js` component is responsible for updating the font styles when the language changes.

# Refactoring Guide

## Goal
To improve the codebase by making it more modular, maintainable, and readable.

## Key Changes
1.  **Component-Based Architecture:** The code was refactored into components, each with a specific responsibility:
    *   `APIManager.js`: Handles all API interactions.
    *   `DownloadUtils.js`: Contains utility functions for downloading the canvas.
    *   `ErrorHandler.js`: Provides a centralized way to handle errors.
    *   `ImageUploadManager.js`: Manages the image upload functionality.
    *   `LanguageManager.js`: Handles language switching and translation.
    *   `SlideRenderer.js`: Renders the slides.
    *   `UIManager.js`: Manages UI interactions.
2.  **Separation of Concerns:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were separated into their own files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`).
3.  **ES6 Modules:** Used ES6 modules (`import`/`export`) to organize the code.
4.  **Clearer Naming:** Variables and functions were renamed to be more descriptive.
5.  **Comments:** Added comments to explain complex parts of the code.

# "Send" Button Implementation

## Feature
A "Send" button that allows the user to send the generated image to a recipient.

## Implementation
This feature is not fully implemented. The current implementation only simulates the "send" action.

### Planned Implementation
1.  **Backend Endpoint:** Create a backend endpoint that can receive the image data.
2.  **Email Service:** Use an email service like SendGrid or Nodemailer to send an email with the image attached.
3.  **API Call:** When the "Send" button is clicked, make an API call to the backend endpoint, sending the image data (as a Base64 string) and the recipient's email address.
4.  **UI:** Add a form for the user to enter the recipient's email address.
